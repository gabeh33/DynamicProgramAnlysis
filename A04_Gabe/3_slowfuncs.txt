1. item::toolmods(). This function is one that appears at the top of my long 
vertical stack of functions. It appears to cycle through all items and check 
if is_toolmod() is true. A possible more efficient way to do this would to store
a global list of toolmod items and reference that. 
2. item_contents::has_pocket_type(pocket_type). Cycles through content array and checks 
if the current content.is_type equals the given pocket_type. If any content is true 
then the function returns true. A faster way would be to keep a counter of the 
number of pocket_type contents, modify that whenever a new content element is 
added to content, and reference it instead of looping. 
3. map::get_vehicles(start, end). This function contains 4 nested for loops. 
It seems to check chunks in the x,y, and z direction and see if they have 
vehicles. Most of the time this is null and the function executes the 
if statement and continues to the next iteration. It seems like storing
this information with other information about chunks would be more 
efficient then cycling through many (mostly empty) chunks looking 
for vehicles.
