1. In the total_allocs.png file, we can clearly see python allocating the most 
heap chuncks comapred to any other process. Bash does start out ahead of python 
for a brief period of time, and then we see sleep overtake bash near the end, due 
to the 10 second sleep command panda runs. In total size, python is the clear winner
with all other processes essentially staying at 0.
2. At the start, there is a string of addresses that are not tainted. However, 
shortly into the log we can see that about half of the bytes are tained and 
leaving the network. By the end I would say about 60% of tained bytes reached
the network
